A quick reference document for freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design.

## Contents

rwb.md
- These are the quick reference notes for Responsive Web Design in markdown format

rwb.html
- This is an HTML document based on the markdown
  - The markdown was converted to HTML using pandoc. Pandoc was executed with settings to create plain HTML
  - A link to JavaScript for code-prettify was added to the HTML to format the <pre> statements
    - https://github.com/googlearchive/code-prettify

styles.css
- Basic CSS to style rwb.html
- The main purpose is to place the table of contents in a sidebar for easy navigation
- Colours and styles are added to emulate the freeCodeCamp look

Known issues
- The html has not been adjusted for mobile devices or smaller screens (the markdown is probably more suitable)
