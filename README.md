# RWBQuickRef
A quick reference document for freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design.

## Overview
I recently completed freeCodeCamps Responsive Web Design Course. I took fairly extensive notes. I found these notes very useful for both revision and as a quick reference when attempting the certification projects. I decided to organise, tidy and improve my notes and share as a reference for others either doing the course or looking for revision materials.

Content credit to freeCodeCamp. The quick reference covers everything they introduce. The notes are expanded using additional information from developers.mozilla and w3schools where I found that I needed more info during the course.

You can view the html file by using the 'githack' URL modification on the raw file. As follows:

## Contents

rwb.md
- These are the quick reference notes for Responsive Web Design in markdown format

rwb.html
- This is an HTML document based on the markdown
  - The markdown was converted to HTML using pandoc. Pandoc was executed with settings to create plain HTML
  - A link to JavaScript for code-prettify was added to the HTML to format the <pre> statements
    - https://github.com/googlearchive/code-prettify

styles.css
- Basic CSS to style rwb.html
- The main purpose is to place the table of contents in a sidebar for easy navigation
- Colours and styles are added to emulate the freeCodeCamp look

Known issues
- The html has not been adjusted for mobile devices or smaller screens (the markdown is probably more suitable)
